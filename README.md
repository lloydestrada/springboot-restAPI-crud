# Spring Boot REST CRUD

This project is built with Spring Boot and demonstrates the creation of a simple REST API performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It focuses on building RESTful endpoints using @RestController, connecting to a MySQL database with Spring Data JPA, and managing entities through standard HTTP methods.

Initially, I explored and tested the system using the DAO pattern to understand the core concepts, before transitioning to JPA Repositories for simpler, cleaner, and more efficient code.

## Features

- REST API with CRUD functionality
- REST API design practices
- Deepens learning of java core

- **Spring Boot Starter Web** – for building REST APIs.
- **Spring Boot Starter Data JPA** – for database operations.
- **Spring Boot DevTools** – for automatic restarts during development.
- **MySQL Driver** – for MySQL database connectivity.
